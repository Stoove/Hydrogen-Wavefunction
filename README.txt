# README file for Hydrogen-Wavefunction
#
# Author: Stoove (stoove@live.com)
#
# Description:
# A project I started as part of my PhD, which aims to develop a set of tools allowing the user to plot
# arbitrary superpositions of Hydrogen wavefunctions, which are important for many reasons.
#
# This package could be used as a learning tool for Physics students, with examples of:
# 	- Spherical harmonics and their applications to real atoms.
# 	- Superposition states (from quantum mechanics) and their real tangible effects.
# 	- Examples of computational techniques in Physics and Mathematics, such as the calculation of Laguerre
# 	  polynomials and spherical harmonics.
# 	- Good coding practice and tricks in Matlab
#
# The package includes:
#
# Hwavfn.m
